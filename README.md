# Chaitanya Rangavajhala – Engineering Leader  
Quantitative Platforms | Securitized Products | Distributed Systems

**New York, NY** · [Email](mailto:crangavajhala@gmail.com) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaitanya-rangavajhala)

Engineering leader with 15+ years of experience building and owning large-scale front-office platforms for pricing, risk, and quantitative analytics in fixed-income and securitized products.

Led global engineering teams delivering systems for Sales & Trading, Quants, and Risk — from real-time loan-level valuation across 150M+ assets to reproducible research environments used by thousands of practitioners.

Hands-on background in distributed systems, cloud-native infrastructure, and real-time streaming platforms, combined with deep domain expertise in securitized products (agency/non-agency MBS, CMBS, ABS, CRT, and whole loans).

## Platform Leadership & Modernization

Led modernization of enterprise-scale real-time data and analytics platforms, scaling them for high-volume workloads while improving reliability, operability, and developer velocity.

**Focus areas included:**
- **Real-time streaming platforms:** Evolved messaging abstractions from application-embedded clients to platform-managed consumption models, balancing latency, reliability, operational ownership, and developer experience at scale.
- **Temporal & AsOf data access:** Designed systems supporting consistent historical and real-time views, informed by bi-temporal financial data models and unified intraday/end-of-day architectures.
- **Scalable storage & caching:** Applied distributed caching and in-memory compute patterns to support low-latency analytics, with change-driven propagation to maintain consistency under load.
- **Change data capture & propagation:** Leveraged source-level CDC patterns to enable low-latency updates while addressing ordering guarantees, schema evolution, and recovery scenarios.

Modernization efforts were guided by cloud-native and operational best practices aligned with the CNCF ecosystem.

## Open-Source Contributions

Most professional work has been in proprietary systems; however, I contribute to open-source projects where it meaningfully improves scale, performance, or observability.

- **BinderHub** (Kubernetes-native research platform)  
  Community maintainer with responsibility for ongoing development, enterprise integrations, and operational reliability.

- **Vitess** (CNCF-graduated distributed database)  
  Authored and merged upstream pull requests improving query performance and observability, adopted in large-scale production environments:  
  - https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18903  
  - https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17342  
  - https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17508  
  - https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17468

## Private Work

Most platform work has been proprietary; architectural approaches, design trade-offs, and lessons learned are discussed conceptually and in an NDA-compliant manner.
