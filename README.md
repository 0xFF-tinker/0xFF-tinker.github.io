Engineering leader with 15+ years building large-scale front-office platforms for pricing, risk, and quantitative analytics in fixed-income and securitized products.

I've led global teams delivering systems for Sales & Trading, Quants, and Risk — from real-time loan-level valuation on 150M+ assets to reproducible research environments for thousands of users.

Hands-on with distributed systems, cloud-native infrastructure, real-time streaming, and open-source tooling. Deep domain experience in Securitized Products (agency/non-agency MBS, CMBS, ABS, CRT, and whole loans).

## Platform Leadership & Modernization

I've led the modernization of enterprise-scale real-time data and analytics platforms, scaling them for high-volume workloads while improving reliability and developer velocity.

- Integrated open-source solutions to reduce technical debt and accelerate delivery.
- Drove gradual cloud-native transformations for better maintainability and resilience.
- Built secure, reproducible environments to support quantitative research and production analytics.

## Open-Source Contributions

Most of my work is proprietary, but I contribute to open-source when it solves meaningful problems at scale:

- **BinderHub** (Kubernetes-native platform, for reproducible quant notebook platform )  
  Community maintainer; responsible for enterprise-scale adoption and integrations.

- **Vitess** (CNCF-graduated distributed database)  
  Authored and merged pull requests improving query performance and observability (adopted in large-scale deployments):  
  - https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/18903  
  - https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17342  
  - https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/17508
